My final submission for the ReliaQuest java-employee-challenge is located in the Final Submission folder.

The folder contains:

An Image_entity file that creates an image object
An employee_entity file that creates an employee object
A file titled "ZachRodreickCodingAssessmeent" which holds common CRUD functions for a RESTful API
